The Open Syllabus Project (OSP) is an effort to create the first large-scale online database of university course syllabi as a platform for the development of new research, teaching, and administrative tools.

Course syllabi are rich documents that connect scholarly communication and teaching to wider intellectual traditions and institutional missions.
									</p>
									<p>
Individually, they offer narrow snapshots of these relationships. Collected, they could do much more. A large-scale, online syllabus archive could provide new ways of understanding some of the core functions of the university. It could enable new lines of inquiry into canon formation, the evolution of disciplines, pedagogical change, and institutional history. It could make curricula more transparent to students, faculty, and administrators, and enable better coordination of course and curricular development. It could introduce new metrics into the conversation about scholarly communication, from tracking the use of open-access publications to measuring how frequently, and in what contexts, faculty members’ works are taught.

The Open Syllabus Project (OSP) is an effort to create the first large-scale online database of university course syllabi as a platform for the development of new research, teaching, and administrative tools. We have this opportunity because, to date, syllabi are almost completely unexploited resources. They are treated as ephemera of the teaching enterprise rather than as its DNA.

OSP development will focus on three broad types of application:

									<h6 class="subtitle"> Curriculum Discovery and Management </h6>
									<p>
At present, there is no systematic means of describing the curriculum in—to the best of our knowledge—any fields. Even within individual schools and departments, administrative knowledge of curricular content is often cursory (limited to course titles and descriptions) or provisional (subject to faculty cooperation). Despite the ongoing ‘databasing’ of university operations, discussions about the university teaching mission (such as curricular change or hiring priorities) still take place with few empirical measures of what’s taught or how it relates to the larger field(s) in which schools or programs operate. This is also a problem for students, who make choices about their own educational trajectories with very little information about the content of their courses. Syllabus tools could make discovery and management of courses much easier for all parties, from students seeking a much more nuanced understand of their options, to faculty designing courses and curricula; to administrators working to understand adjacencies and redundancies in key areas.
